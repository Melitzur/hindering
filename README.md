# Hindered Growth

This git is a companion to the paper *Detrending and Fluctuation Analysis of Growth Processes* by M. Elitzur, Ž. Ivezić and D. Zilberman.  Directory `modeling` contains the entire programing package employed in the analysis described in that paper. The package files contain extensive documentation that describes the algorithms and the various options.

The notebook `demo.ipynb` demonstrates usage of the modeling package, reproducing the analysis presented in the paper of the US population and GDP from 1790-2021. Running this notebook requires a python installation with python 3.8+ that includes the packages numpy, scipy, statsmodels, numba and matplotlib.
